# Data Analysis Msc Data Science

This Streamlit web application provides a comprehensive analysis of MSc Data Science programs across 

various universities. Designed for educators, students, and academic researchers, the application allows 

users to explore, compare, and identify trends in program offerings, delivery formats, core courses, and 

specializations.

## Features

1. Program Content Comparisons
Compare university programs based on selected columns such as:
